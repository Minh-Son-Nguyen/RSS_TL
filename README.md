# Multi-Surrogate-Teacher Assistance for Representation Alignment in Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization

This is the official repository of "_Multi-Surrogate-Teacher Assistance for Representation Alignment in Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization_", a knowledge-transfer framework designed to enable most SoTA localization methods to learn transferable representations that are insensitive to environmental dynamics. This is achieved by aligning underlying knowledge derived from target RSS fingerprint datasets with that of public source datasets, represented through source surrogate teacher networks.
