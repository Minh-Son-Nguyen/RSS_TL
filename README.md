# Multi-Surrogate-Teacher Assistance for Representation Alignment in Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization

This is the official repository of "_Multi-Surrogate-Teacher Assistance for Representation Alignment in Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization_", a knowledge-transfer framework designed to facilitate the learning of transferable representations that are insensitive to environmental dynamics in most state-of-the-art (SoTA) localization methods. This is achieved by aligning underlying knowledge extracted from target RSS fingerprint datasets with that of public source datasets, represented through source surrogate teacher networks.
